# Community Forum

This repository is designed for community proposals and discussion related to the Oasis Network. Proposals can be published by any community member and are used to collect feedback, and engage in discussion on key milestones, roadmap items and features of the network.

## Getting Started

To start a discussion use the [_Discussions_ ](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/community/discussions) GitHub feature. Make sure to select the right category -- if you're not sure which one is the most appropriate use _General_.

## Broadcasting for Feedback

Once published we also recommend sharing your issue in the [Oasis Community Slack](https://oasisprotocol.org/slack) node operator channel `#nodeoperators`.
